                    Arkansas, like many places around the globe, is facing a shortage of masks and other personal protection equipment (PPE).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Innovation Hub is working with several hospitals and local universities to innovate new solutions to these supply gaps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the past few days, we have been researching masks, face shields, materials, manufacturing options, supply lines, and more—as well as producing and iterating designs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We aim to provide feedback to local makers on what hospitals need—and the designs they find most beneficial. Through this effort, we hope to give a platform for the Arkansas Maker community to discuss and develop solutions to every aspect of this uniquely challenging problem.
                </p>
